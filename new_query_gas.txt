Please assume you are developer which has written below SHACL query for industry-fusion foundation and use it as a template
to generate new SHACL query for below request:                                                                   
Proof of gas pressure/flow for cutting process for with below constraints
Goal:
For the cutting process on CNC cutting systems, a defined pressure and a specified flow rate of gas (or various gases, depending on the process) must be maintained. In order to ensure that these parameters are adhered to, the gas extraction point, which is connected to the CNC cutting system, 
is to be equipped with appropriate sensors and the values are to be documented.
K:
Requires specific window 10 -12 bar at the entrance. Inlet pressure is measured, outlet pressure is set and output.
It would be interesting to know whether enough gas is available before starting the cutting process.
Gas consumption / flow:
Gas consumption is determined in tests and transferred to the database. During operation, the value is read and set from the database, but no longer measured.
Pressure in bottles:
Highly compressed gases, e.g. Ar, correspond to the high pressure of the filling.
